# Canvas-Instructor-Application-Version-2.0
This is a improved version Canvas Instructor Application in which you, as a professor, can keep track of your students, post new assignments and tests. It is a flask web-framework based application. I have used Python, Flask, Jinja[very little] and HTML in this code.
